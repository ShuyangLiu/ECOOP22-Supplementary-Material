LISA HSA14 (*variant of mp*)
(*p. 79/84
There are two races in this example. First, the atomic load by B races with the
atomic store by A because the workgroup scopes are not inclusive. Second,
because the scopes used for synchronization similarly do not match, the write
and read of ordinary variable X form a race.

LISA HSA7 (*variant of mp*)
(*
At the conclusion of this example, $s2 must get the value 53. This outcome is
enforced by the requirement that the coherent orders, , must be consistent with
the happens-before order, , which prevents the coherent order for location X
from being store ‘52’ -> load -> store ‘53’.

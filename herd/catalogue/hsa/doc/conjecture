def consistent(a,b) = irreflexive a;b

forall r1, r2, r3 

(exists total order o, consistent with r1 and consistent with r2 and consistent
with r3

  <->

 partial order (r1 | r2 | r3)+)

i.e.

<- take o = topo sort of (r1 | r2 | r3)+

-> suppose r = (r1 | r2 | r3)+ is not a partial order. since r is transitive by
definition, this means that r is not irreflexive, i.e. exists x, (x,x) in r.

our cycle is a path P made of steps of r1, r2 or r3, from x to x. 

now by hypothesis we know that there exists a total order o such that:

irreflexive o;r1, i.e. ~exists x1, (x1,x1) in r1;o
irreflexive o;r2, i.e. ~exists x2, (x2,x2) in o;r2
irreflexive o;r3, i.e. ~exists x3, (x3,x3) in o;r3

. consider a step of r1 in P, i.e. a -r1-> b:
  because o is total, we have either a -o-> b or b -o-> a.
  because o is consistent with r1, we cannot have b -o-> a.
  thus a -o-> b

. similarly for each step a -r2-> b or a -r3-> b we must have a -o-> b

. thus our path P is also a path in o+, from x to x. we've just created a cycle
in o, a contradiction of the fact that o is a total order.

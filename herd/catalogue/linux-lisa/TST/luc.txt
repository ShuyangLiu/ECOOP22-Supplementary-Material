L01.cat: integrate footnotes (ie all code before/after considered in sl/ue
and not only read-side critical sections).

3 threads with pairs ???

In memory-barrier.txt : L1242
... demonnstrates transitivity (also called "cumulativity"):
L'exemple c'est RWC.

Transitive vs. non transitive

Is RW-C+RW-C+RW-C (aka 3.LB+ctrls) allowed or forbidden ?
(Cf. also
litmus/RW-r+RW-C+RW-B  listed as forbidden, which the model allows.





==============================

Summary of testing.
1R1Gdeadlock : deadlock not handled.
R1n1G : nested read-side critical section, not handled.
2qR1G : release-acquire  in rs-cs, not handled.


** Doc 
The tarball has the whole mess.  The scripts are in the RCUmodel
directory.  I tested your new .cat file with the following command,
run in that directory:

Run:
LINUX_CAT_FILE=L.2015.11.12a.cat sh runAllAuxCat.sh > runAllAuxCat.sh.L1.2015.11.12a.out 2>&1&


** Warning

Changed:
LISA2R2G.litmus

Something wrong with implicit MB ?? Cf 

** Old stuff

---- Solved by----
(* All solved by adding mb into grace-hb acyclicity test *)
2Re1G : barrier in rs-cs, not handled,
2Rec1G : barrier in rs-cs, not handled,
2Rf1G : idem

----


1Rib1G : with mb should be forbidden ?? implicit mb not ok ?

2Rt1G : rs-cs in program order, not handled.

LISA LB+o-rel+o-rel (*Paul says allowed*)
{
x = 0;
y = 0;
}
P0              | P1              ;
r[once] r1 x    | r[once] r3 y    ;
w[release] y 1  | w[release] x 1  ;
exists(0:r1=1 /\ 1:r3=1)

(*More precisely, Paul says, about the dual LB+acq-o+acq-o:

        The reason for saying "OK" is because C11 and C++11 would allow
        this cycle -- no "synchronizes-with" relationship.  The reason
        I might care is that it would be good to be able to map at least
        some of the Linux kernel primitives into C11.  ;-)
        This would mean that lb+o-rel+o-rel would also be allowed, in
        contrast to our discussions last week.
